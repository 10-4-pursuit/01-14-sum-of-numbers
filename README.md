# Sum of Numbers

## Description
Write a program that calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to a given number using a `for` loop.

## Objective
- Use a `for` loop to sum up numbers from 1 to a given number (e.g., 10).
- Console log the final sum.

## Instructions
- In `index.js`, complete the `for` loop to iterate from 1 to the given number.
- Accumulate the sum of numbers within the loop.
- Console log the final sum after the loop completes.

## Setup
1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `01-14-sum-of-numbers` directory.
3. Fill in the `index.js` according to the instructions.

## Test Cases
- If the given number is 10, the console should log `55` (the sum of numbers from 1 to 10).
